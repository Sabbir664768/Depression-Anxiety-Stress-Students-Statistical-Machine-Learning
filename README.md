**Title:** Depression, Anxiety, and Stress among University Students through Statistical and Machine Learning Algorithms 

**Abstract**

**Background**

Mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and stress, are significant global challenges affecting individuals' well-being and daily functioning. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of various statistical and machine learning (ML) algorithms in predicting these conditions among university students in Bangladesh to identify the best model for early detection in a resource-limited setting.

**Methods**

Data were collected from 384 students at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Gopalganj, Bangladesh using stratified random sampling and self-administered questionnaires, including socio-demographic details and the BDASS-21 tool. Statistical and ML algorithms multinomial logistic regression (MLR), random forest (RF), Na√Øve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) were evaluated for predicting mental health severity, with performance metrics used to determine the most accurate model.

**Results**

The study found that most students experienced moderate levels of depression (30.7%), with high levels of anxiety, where 35.4% reported extremely severe anxiety. Stress levels were predominantly normal (37.5%), with some students experiencing severe stress (21.1%). Among ML models, SVM performed best in predicting depression, anxiety, and stress with high accuracy and balanced performance metrics, while NB showed the poorest performance across most measures. Key predictors of mental health issues included feelings of low self-worth, lack of motivation, and a sense of meaninglessness. 

**Conclusion**

The SVM model proved superior in predicting mental health conditions among university students, outperforming other models in accuracy and consistency. KNN, RF, and GB also performed well, but SVM is recommended as the primary tool for mental health prediction, with complementary models enhancing overall prediction accuracy.
